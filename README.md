# Gunny
## A Frontend for Lightguns
### This project is currently in the ALPHA stage

My goal with this project is to be able to easily add games/emulators,
and then select and play those games with an aesthetically pleasing interface.
Right now I need help testing this out. **A lot.** This is an alpha, so **you will find bugs!** 


## Getting Started
1. Add/edit your emulators.
   - If you are planning to use MAME or Teknoparrot, simply click "Edit Emulators" and point to the correct .exe files.
   - Any other emulators can be added by clicking "Add Emulators"...duh.
2. Add Games.
   - You must enter the **game name**, **rom file**, and **emulator selection**. Everything else is optional. (Highly recommended to add images/video snaps, etc.)
3. That's it! You can mess with settings if you want/need to, but you're pretty much ready to go.

## Testing
I need help testing this program on lots of different PC setups, so don't be shy! If the program crashes, please reach out and give me as much info as possible
so that I can work on it. We can talk here, or on reddit (u/Soultie). I'll eventually open a discord for this. 
If the program runs slowly, I recommend disabling "selection smoke" in the GUI options menu.

## What I need to add
1. I plan on adding the ability to scan rom folders in order to automatically add games per emulator.
2. I would like to be able to import Emulationstation gamelists.
3. Gamepad functionality?
4. I am open to suggestions/tester feedback.

### Thanks a lot, have fun!   
         
P.S. The program is too large to upload on github. On the releases page there will be a link to download.  
ALSO, when adding Teknoparrot games, the "roms" are the game.xml files in the "Game_profiles" folder of the teknoparrot installation directory.
